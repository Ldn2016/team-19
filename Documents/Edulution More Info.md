- Future courses too

- Work seemlessly with anything thats online/offline or on the tablet itself

## Current App

- Just a playlist of embedded links of videos and exercises
- Every 4 months, there is a test to monitor how they do it
- Current an embedded google form
- Google form that marks it
- Machine learning  !!! make courses more effective

## How the old app works?
1. Baseline Test 
2.	Coach Heatmap
	1.	In the heatmap, tells you what areas the children are weak on
	2.	Something machine learning here?
3.	Targeted intervention using Coach, Khan Academy Lite and Playlists

# Data Model

	- What the user actually learns
	- All_items
	- Every item in the database

Give dataset for one centre operating for 6 months
15 centres (8 in inner cities need 4x4 to get there $15 earnings per month. 7 are in rural areas)
Age Range = Grade 4 (8 years old) up to senior years (first year of uni)
They can be embarrassed if they start older

- Data Model
- Students are doing all kinds of exercises 
- They do not know how the exercises relate to the childrens actual performance
- Can see how they have done on each question
